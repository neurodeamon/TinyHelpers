############   TinyHelpers   ################

TinyHelpers is a collection of small tools that I wrote for a specific purpose
and to satisfy my urge to learn something new (in AutoIt, AutoHotKey and C#).

I know it's no million rows of code, but for me it was a big deal to learn (even if it is messy at times)!

So feel free to use it if you're a beginner or commit some code if you're an advanced user
or even a hacker with |337 skills.
